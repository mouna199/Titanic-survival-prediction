### Titanic survival Vizualisation 

Presentation:

In this project, we will investigate data related to titanic sinking.

We want to investigate data and see what were the characteristics of people who died and people who survived. First, we need to get to know our data, by printing some examples and the type of each variable. Then we clean and reorganize the variables before proceeding to the part of answering our question and making vizualisation.
We will need to import pandas since we will be using our dataframes, and matplotlib to make some visualisations

### Conclusion

To answer our question, which is what variables correlated to the surviving of titanic riders, we did a descriptive analysis after cleaning our data, along with some vizualisation. This helped us notice that sex, Class and age correlated with surviving.This is showing in women and kids who were resuced first, and that first and second class were among the survivors while old men from third class were the ones who presented the majority of the dead. Maybe that men from third class were far from the boats, and sinked first, or because of their social status , they couldn't get on the boats. However, we can't say that these people survived because of their sex , age or class. To answer such question, we need to do an inference study , by comparing the mean age of survivors and dead and see if is the difference is significant or not using statistical test.
