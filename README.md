### Titanic survival Vizualisation 

Presentation:

In this project, we will investigate data related to titanic sinking. We want to investigate data and see what were the characteristics of people who died and people who survived. First, we need to get to know our data, by printing some examples and the type of each variable. Then we clean and reorganize the variables before proceeding to the part of answering our question and making vizualisation. We will need to import pandas since we will be using our dataframes, and matplotlib to make some visualisations
